    "### Improving representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly, the arguments of the class ```vectorizer``` will allow us to easily change the way our textual data is represented. Let us try to work on our *Bag-of-words* representations:\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Do not take into account words that are too frequent:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the argument ```max_df=1.0``` to change the amount of words taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try different granularities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than just counting words, we can count sequences of words - limited in size, of course. \n",
    "We call a sequence of $n$ words a $n$-gram: let's try using 2 and 3-grams (bi- and trigrams).\n",
    "We can also try to use character sequences instead of word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be interested in the options ```analyze='word'``` and ```ngram_range=(1, 2)``` which we'll change to alter the granularity: **obtain classification results with them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again: using these ways of getting more features from our text will probably have more impact if we do not have much training data to begin with ! To accelerate experiments, use the ```Pipeline``` tool from scikit-learn. \n",
